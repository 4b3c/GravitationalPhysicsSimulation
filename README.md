I created this project as a joint Honors Contract for my physics and programming classes. It serves to simulate the
orbits of bodies of variable masses, locations, and initial velocities. Each frame, the forces between each body are
calculated using Newtons's universal law of gravitation. Once the 3 dimensional force is calculated, the accelerations
of each body can be calculated, and then the velocities and positions can be updated.
