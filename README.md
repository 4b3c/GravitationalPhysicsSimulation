I created this project as a joint Honors Contract for my physics and programming classes. It serves to simulate the
orbits of bodies of variable masses, locations, and initial velocities. The forces between each body are then calculated
using Newtons's universal law of gravitation. Once the 3D force is calculated, the accelerations of each body can be
calculated, and then the velocities and positions can be updated.
